# Testing JS Promises

Exploring Bluebird and exposing problems on JQuery's promises.

### Instructions

Uncomment the JS script in `index.html` before running it.

Some JS files need to comment/uncomment each section so that all the examples will not run at the same time.

Enable Firebug or equivalent to see the console logs.
